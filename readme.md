**Basic Raycasting Showcase**


Summary:

In this program, a basic showcase of the technique known as 'raycasting' will be demonstrated.
Raycasting at a fundamental level is, as the name would imply, the casting of rays from a viewing point out onto a 2D map to detect what surface is being hit by the corresponding ray, and at what distance.
This information is then displayed visually to give the illusion that you are viewing from the eyes of a 2D character on screen.


Instructions:

- Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate your camera view left and right accordingly
- Look at either the over-head 2D map being detected, or the first-person view below on screen
